0.03	26 January 2002
	Adapted NexTrieve's "ntvhtml2ntvml" filter for use with the NexTrieve
	module and added as a script named "html2ntvml" and added test of
	usage to 12html.t.  Adapted MANIFEST accordingly.

	Finished first public version of NexTrieve::HTML module and added
	test-file 12html.t.

	25 January 2002
	Fixed up encoding issues over all objects, especially with
	NexTrieve::Document and NexTrieve::Docseq.  If a document has an
	encoding different from the docseq, then the XML will be automatically
	converted using the "recode" method in the NexTrieve.pm module.

	Added the first automatic recoding handler searching strategy to
	method "find_recoding" and added the recoding handler that uses
	"iconv".

	22 January 2002
	Re-arranged the still incomplete NexTrieve::Collection module to
	have the major part of its intelligence moved to the new
	NexTrieve::Collection::Index module.

	Created first version of NexTrieve::Collection::Index module.

	21 January 2002
	Fixed bug in $deamon->pid: now removes the newline from the string
	so that the pid becomes truly numeric.

	Started work on NexTrieve::HTML based on the ntvhtml2ntvml script.

	Added method "Queries" to NexTrieve::Querylog.

0.02	20 January 2002
	$daemon->pid now waits for a max of 5 seconds to see whether the
	pid-file appears, before returning with an error.

	$daemon->start now returns the object itself: since the return value
	of starting the daemon is of little value anyway, it makes more sense
	to return the object, so that you can do one-liners.

	Fixed problem in $ntv->anyport: older IO::Socket::INET _must_ have a
	Listen specification, apparently.

	Fixed problem in NexTrieve::Docseq: apparently a string resembling a	
	a namespace is illegal as an unquoted key value in a hash reference
	specification in perl 5.005.

	Changed various test from direct comparisons to just checking whether
	the object was created without errors: that should teach me not to
	depend on the order of keys in a hash.

	Fixed problem in NexTrieve.pm with perl 5.005: $object->$method
	apparently _must_ be $object->$method();

	Fixed problem with $ntv->Search not setting method/value pairs.

	Added "command" method to NexTrieve::Replay;

	Added "eof" methods to NexTrieve::Querylog and NexTrieve::Replay.

0.01	19 January 2002
	First upload to CPAN.

	First version for the 2.X generation of NexTrieve.  Some code and
	concepts were used from the old Nextrieve.pm module (note the
	lowercase t) that was written by me in 1995 and heavily used by
	all search engines of customers of xxLINK.
