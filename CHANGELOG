	$daemon->pid now waits for a max of 5 seconds to see whether the
	pid-file appears, before returning with an error.

	$daemon->start now returns the object itself: since the return value
	of starting the daemon is of little value anyway, it makes more sense
	to return the object, so that you can do one-liners.

	Fixed problem in $ntv->anyport: older IO::Socket::INET _must_ have a
	Listen specification, apparently.

	Fixed problem in NexTrieve::Docseq: apparently a string resembling a	
	a namespace is illegal as an unquoted key value in a hash reference
	specification in perl 5.005.

	Changed various test from direct comparisons to just checking whether
	the object was created without errors: that should teach me not to
	depend on the order of keys in a hash.

	Fixed problem in NexTrieve.pm with perl 5.005: $object->$method
	apparently _must_ be $object->$method();

	Fixed problem with $ntv->Search not setting method/value pairs.

	Added "command" method to NexTrieve::Replay;

	Added "eof" methods to NexTrieve::Querylog and NexTrieve::Replay.

	First upload to CPAN.

	First version for the 2.X generation of NexTrieve.  Some code and
	concepts were used from the old Nextrieve.pm module (note the
	lowercase t) that was written by me in 1995 and heavily used by
	all search engines of customers of xxLINK.
