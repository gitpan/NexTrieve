The family of NexTrieve:: modules provide a completely object-oriented
support for the NexTrieve search engine software, as available from:

 http://www.nextrieve.com/

It allows you to index your information from various sources, and perform
searches on those indexes by using ad-hoc access (or low-traffic search
engines) and access by a search daemon running on a port, all using the
perl modules.

Almost all aspects of NexTrieve are handled through XML.  If you are not
well versed in the handling of XML, and you are well versed in using Perl,
then these Perl modules are for you: they will handle everything in a
completely object-oriented manner.

The following modules are part of the basic distribution:

 NexTrieve                      base module
 NexTrieve::Collection          logical collection object
 NexTrieve::Daemon              logical daemon object
 NexTrieve::Docseq              logical document sequence for indexing
 NexTrieve::Document            logical document object
 NexTrieve::Resource            create/adapt resource-file
 NexTrieve::Index               index XML
 NexTrieve::Replay              turn Querylog into Hitlist objects
 NexTrieve::Search              logical search engine object
 NexTrieve::Query               create/adapt query
 NexTrieve::Querylog            turn query log into Query objects
 NexTrieve::Hitlist             result of query from search engine
 NexTrieve::Hitlist::Hit        a single hit of the result

If you are used to handling XML in Perl, you probably only need the
IO::Socket module to perform searches with NexTrieve.

The build is standard:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
