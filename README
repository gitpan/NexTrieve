The family of NexTrieve:: modules provide a completely object-oriented
support for the NexTrieve search engine software, as available from:

 http://www.nextrieve.com/

It allows you to index your information from various sources, and perform
searches on those indexes by using ad-hoc access (or low-traffic search
engines) and access by a search daemon running on a port, all using the
perl modules.

Almost all aspects of NexTrieve are handled through XML.  If you are not
well versed in the handling of XML, and you are well versed in using Perl,
then these Perl modules are for you: they will handle everything in a
completely object-oriented manner.
